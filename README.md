# Pregnancy Companion Web App

This project now has separate folders for the frontend and a beginner-level backend.

- **frontend/** – React + Vite application.
- **backend/** – Simple Node.js HTTP server.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
The backend listens on port 3000 and responds with a greeting at the root URL.
